## Prepare a virtual private server (VPS)

This guide is written for setting up a VPS with [Lunanode](https://www.lunanode.com/), a solid hosting provider based in Toronto, Ontario. We recommend them partly because we've been running a Lightning node there for several years, and partly because they accept Lightning payments directly into their own node. For the purpose of running a Lightning Node, you may choose any other provider, given they can give you full ssh access to a Linux instance.

Other popular providers that accept Lightning are [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/vps/), [Cherryservers](https://www.cherryservers.com/), [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/) or [Bitlaunch](https://bitlaunch.io/) (reselling Digital Ocean).

### Create an account

First, you will need to create an account. You'll be asked for an email address, password and a country. They will later require a phone number for verification, so if you are using a service like [SMS4SATS](https://sms4sats.com/), plan ahead!

**Your security is important:** If you signed up with a phone number that isn't yours, make sure this phone number isn't automatically added to your account for recovery purposes. Under _Account_ in the top panel, you can opt into two-factor authentication. I recommend "time-based one-time password".

### Deposit funds into your account

We will have to deposit some funds into our account. Under _Billing_ in the top panel we can make a lump-sum payment into our account. Try adding US$5 via BTCPay (Lightning) if you already have a mobile Lightning wallet.

### SSH access

In this step, we are going to get ready to access our server from our personal computer via SSH. To do that, we are going to first create an SSH key. We recommend you creating a new SSH key, in case you will later need to revoke it or exchange it.

#### Create an SSH key on your personal machine

In Mac OS X, Windows or Linux we are going to open a terminal for the first time and execute the following.

```shell
ssh-keygen
```
Windows: 
- Open Windows Powershell
- type `ssh-keygen`
- *** IMPORTANT *** Do not enter a key name
- Follow the prompts and a new 'id_rsa.pub' (public key) and 'id_rsa' (private key) files will be generated  at `C:\Users\userName\.ssh\id_rsa.pub` 

Linux, Mac OS X: 

We are typically asked for a name for this key, for example `nodekey_rsa`. You may optionally choose a passphrase for this key, meaning you will have to enter this passphrase every time you log into your machine. Your public key will be called `newkey_rsa.pub` and it will be saved in the following location:

Linux: `~/.ssh/newkey_rsa.pub`
Mac OS: `/Users/MYUSERNAME/.ssh/newkey_rsa.pub`

In our Lunanode account, under _Account_, we can find the option _SSH Keys_. We can add our SSH key there. Give it a name (ideally the name of the computer that belongs to this key), paste your public key into the appropriate field and add it.

You can add multiple SSH keys here, for example if you want to access your server both from your desktop and laptop computer. Just repeat the steps above and add the two keys separately into your Lunanode account. Be careful to only add the **public** keys: they end with `.pub`.

### Provision your first VPS

Under _Virtual Machines_ on the left panel, we are going to _Create a new virtual machine_. At the moment, there is only one region to choose from, so we'll place our node in Ontario.

In the next step we'll first give it a hostname. If you plan to point a domain name at your server, then that would make for a good hostname. Otherwise, anything descriptive will do, such as _node_ or _lnd_.

The most difficult decision is what server we want to provision. The "memory optimized" servers tend to be a good choice, as a bitcoin and Lightning node consume disproportionately more RAM than CPU power. And for the CPU-intensive syncronization process we can choose to pay for acceleration later.

The **m.4** instance is probably a good minimum for a Lightning node. It is possible to run a node on an m.2 instance, but the node does not come with enough local storage to compile Bitcoin Core and LND.

Next, we are going to choose the operating system. **Ubuntu 24.04 64-bit** is what we are going to choose, but _Debian 12 64-bit_ is very similar and will work just as well. Another popular option for professionally run nodes is CentOS 8 64-bit. It's important we are choosing an 64-bit operating system, or else we might crash our node once it's channel.db reaches 2GB or more.

Finally we will select our SSH key or keys and provision our VPS by clicking on _Create virtual machine_.

### Connect to your node over SSH

Under _Virtual machines_ we should now see our VPS. After a minute or two, the yellow box should turn green, meaning our VPS is ready. We can see its **External IP**, as well as its **IPv6**. We can use either of them to connect to our node from our personal computer.

On our personal computer, we are going to open a terminal and type

```shell
ssh ubuntu@<our node's ip address>
```

For example

```shell
ssh ubuntu@172.81.181.220
```

If you are running into errors, you may have to specify the location and name of the SSH key you want to use:

```shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa <username>@<ip address>
```

As this is our first time connecting to our node, we are prompted with the message _The authenticity of the host can't be established._ We will continue to connect by typing `yes`, but the next time we see that message we should be suspicious. This principle is called "Trust on First Use" or Tofu.

The terminal should read:

> Welcome to `Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-31-generic x86_64)`

We have successfully provisioned our server!

### Attach a volume

Our server comes with some space on an SSD, but we might want to have more, especially for the Bitcoin blockchain. Luckily, we can buy additional space and attach it to our server.

#### Create the volume

First, we will power off our node. We are going to do that through the Lunanode dashboard. Under _Virtual Machines_ we will select _Manage_, then _Shut Down_. We can verify that it is shut down by its status changing to _Offline_.

On the left of the screen, we find the option _Volumes_. We select our region (Toronto), give it a name (for example `bitcoin`) and decide on a size. For a Bitcoin node that is used as a backend to our node, 50GB is a good size for a small node. That's about 24 weeks worth of blocks. For a more performant node, 80GB or even 120GB might be a decent choice too. The entire blockchain takes up about 600GB today, and growing by about 2GB per week, so running a full archival node on a VPS might not be economical, as Lunanode will charge us US$36 per month for a 600GB large SSD.

We will leave the volume empty (_Source_) and create it.

The volume should appear instantly in our volume list. We will click on _Manage_ and then _Attach to VM_ where we select our node under _Virtual Machine_ and _virtio_ as a driver. This won't work if our server isn't shut down. Only once our volume reads _Attached to_ our node we can go back into _Virtual Machines_, then _Manage_, then _Start Up_ our node. Once we can see _Status_ changed to _Online_ we can log back into our node with SSH.

#### Format the volume

We will log back into our node via SSH from our personal computer.

We can execute the following command to check if our volume is successfully attached:

```shell
lsblk
```

Typically, we will find it at the very bottom labelled `vdc`. The main storage partition of our server is likely called `vda`. You should be able to see their sizes too.

Next, we are going to format this SSD. We type and execute:

```shell
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc
```

Depending on the size of your volume, this can be very fast or take a minute.

Now, we are going to permanently mount this volume. First we are going to create a directory called `bitcoin`.

```shell
sudo mkdir /mnt/bitcoin
```

Next, we are going to mount the drive at this directory.

```shell
sudo mount /dev/vdc /mnt/bitcoin
```

We can see a list of all mounted volumes with the `df` utility.

```shell
df -h
```

Finally, we are going to give permission over this new volume back to the user ubuntu, as it is initially owned by the root user.

```shell
sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu /mnt/bitcoin
```

To make sure our server automatically mounts this volume when we start it, we are going to have to edit some configuration files.

First, we will find out the UUID of our SSD by running the following. If we can't see our drive, we have to reboot the machine with `sudo reboot now`, then reconnect via SSH:

```shell
lsblk -f
```

Typically, the last line will show the mounted bitcoin disk. Look for `vdc` under NAME and `/mnt/bitcoin` under MOUNTPOINTS. A typical UUID looks like this: `50fb9f4-60e7-4024-adde-2a9959214dd6`.

Next, we are going to open the nano editor and edit the `fstab` file:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

We are going to paste (right-click and paste or if your computer/mouse has one, the middle button) the following line:

`UUID=<your SSD's UUID> <your mount path> ext4 defaults 0 0`

For example:

`UUID=050fb9f4-60e7-4024-adde-2a9959214dd6 /mnt/bitcoin ext4 defaults 0 0`

Now are going to save the file with `Ctrl` + `O` and exit the editor with `Ctrl` + `X`.

We are going to test our configuration by mounting all the volumes.

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo mount -a
```

If this succeeds without error, we can optionally reboot our server.

```shell
sudo reboot now
```

We will have to wait a minute for our server to reboot before we can log back in with SSH.

```shell
df -h
```

We should see something like the following.

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
tmpfs            98M  996K   97M   2% /run
/dev/vda1        16G  2.0G   14G  13% /
tmpfs           486M     0  486M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
/dev/vdc        4.9G   24K   80G   0% /mnt/bitcoin
/dev/vda15      105M  5.3M  100M   5% /boot/efi
tmpfs            98M  4.0K   98M   1% /run/user/1000
```

**You have successfully set up your VPS and attached a volume. Congratulations!**
